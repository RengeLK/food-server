# `food-server`
`food-server` is a server implementation for the Demae channel. It allows you to order food directly from your Wii, and create restaurant reservations.

## Self-Hosting
If you decide to self-host, you will need a basic understanding of Python as well as Python 3.
Please see information available on [our wiki](https://wiilink.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/pages/1376271/Self+Hosting).

NOTE: Aside from these instructions, we will not be helping people self-host. Please do not ask.
